Ex [oriflame](https://oriflame.com/) Frontend architect and current frontend dev lead in [PWC](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en.html).

I am huge fan of open source and when I can I try to contribute I have a few contributions to the opensource projects. I would love to contribute more, but I am limited by the time that I can spend on the contributions, and work on something meaningful that can help others.

I love the work that you are doing with tailwind that is why I would love to join, I love new challenges and since I was mostly working on frontend and not that much on tooling this really excites me. I did a few design systems, toolkits, code mods and others. Sometimes I did even devops by accident.

Now I am really looking for some exciting and challenging work that can help developers.
