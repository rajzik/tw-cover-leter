> Hello everyone, since I am not a good writer about myself, I've created a changelog of my experiences.
> The following changelog is just a short introduction about my experiences that I've had so far. I know that you have thousands of applicants, but I said, 'I'm going to try it, what is the worst that can happen'.

## Breaking changes

> Experience

- `PwC` - Frontend developer lead
  - _2022_ - _present_
  - Since I joined the team there has been a huge shift in the direction of the front end and backend and my responsibility was to decide what is the best solution Longterm which was shift from create react app to next with step-by-step migration. Currently I am also acting lead of the whole team as was needed for the project.
- `ORIFLAME SOFTWARE` - Frontend architect
  - _2019_ - _2022_
  - I started as a senior developer and after a while I was promoted to the frontend architect, I had so many improvements in mind for other teams that I was able to fulfil, since I had experience in the feature team, I knew exactly what they needed. This was my first job where I was able to create companywide libraries, tooling, and design system. It was also the first time I did companywide workshops. There was so much more than I did I can't even remember.
- `ROI Hunter` - Senior frontend Developer
  - _2019_ - _2019_
  - Short-lived experience on smaller project for e-commerce. I was hired to fix the project and finish typescript migration.
- `IXPERTA s.r.o.` - Junior frontend engineer
  - _2015_ - _2019_
  - The beginning of my career, in this job I got assigned frontend role even though I didn't really work with web before, but it sparked the enthusiasm that I have today, started with just html template with java backend, I moved to jQuery, then I moved to the Angular 1 and after that I found my passion in react and react like frameworks. I've learned so much in such a short time.

## Features

> Projects that are available

- `Ori UI` - Design system for oriflame based on material-ui. [storybook](https://storybook.oriflame.com/)
  - Material-ui based design system that started as theme and then expanded to self-sufficient product. I've started this project and most of the work is still present. Just a few features of this project: automatic tests with coverage above 98%, visual tests, codemod for migration between versions, optimized build, and node and webpack optimizations. Documentation is written in storybook it is mostly short but worked well.
- `Lumos` - Build tool created for oriflame [Lumos](https://github.com/Oriflame/lumos)
  - Tooling system that made our policies easy to apply and update. At the time it was great project that helped every team to stick to guidelines and update without hustle. It contained webpack, babel, eslint, prettier config. With this tool you needed just a single configuration file, and everything was set up for you. You could easily build a library (with types, ecmascript modules and common js), deployable website, or both with few commands.
